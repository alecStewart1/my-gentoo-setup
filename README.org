#+TITLE: My Gentoo Setup
#+AUTHOR: Alec Stewart

These are configuration files and some scripts for setting up Gentoo
on my current machine.

As of first writing this readme (<2022-06-28 Tue>) I myself am pretty green to Gentoo.

My hope is that this repo will contain ebuilds, more configurations and more scripts that I can
share for setting up and working with Gentoo and its systems.

* Why put them online?

Because maybe someone new to Gentoo might find it useful to look through.

Or maybe I could get feedback from an experienced Gentoo user by sharing this repo, and maybe they
learn something new (though I sort of doubt that would happen).

Itâ€™s also nice to have another place backup my configurations.
